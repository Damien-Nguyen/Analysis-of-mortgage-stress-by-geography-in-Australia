Our project is to analyse mortagage stress by geography in NSW, Australia. Mortgage stress defined as an excessive portion of income dedicated to mortgage payments  

## Background

Interest rates have risen rapidly during 2022 and further rate rised are expected in 2023.  This is resulting in significant inreases in mortgage repayments.  Where a household is in 'mortgage stress' where it has an excessive portion of its income allocated to mortgage payments.

## Fin Tech use of mortgage stress data

Many online/digital home loan providers have emerged (e.g. Ubank, Unloan, etc) which would be interested in geographical areas of high mortgage stress.

## Questions asked

1) Characteristics of mortgage stress for NSW in aggregate
2) NSW regions with highest levels of mortgage stress 
3) Drivers for mortgage stress

## Data Sources used

1)  Australia Bureau of Statstics (ABS)
2)  Reserve bank of Australia (RBA)
3)  Folium for geospatial
4)  Domain.com.au for analysis

## Summary of findings

Highest levels of mortgage stress are in Sydney and within Sydney the highest levels are in the Northern Beaches/Baulkham Hills and Hawksbury.

## Data challenges/Postmortem

1) ABS website has many different ways to extract data which is confusing
2) ABS API difficult to use
3) Some APIs have a cost or take time to set-up
4) Data gaps exist in lower level ABS geographic data
