Our project is to analyse mortagage stress by geography in NSW, Australia. 

## Background

Interest rates have risen rapidly during 2022 and further rate rised are expected in 2023.  This is resulting in significant inreases in mortgage repayments.  Where a household is in 'mortgage stress' where it has an excessive portion of its income allocated to mortgage payments.

## Fin Tech use of mortgage stress data

A number of online home offerings have emerged in a competitive home loan markets.  Understanding regions with mortgage stress may assist with credit decisioning i.e. charge higher interest rates or reduce lending approvals in areas with high level of stress. 

## Data Sources used

1)  Australia Bureau of Statstics (ABS)
2)  Reserve bank of Australia (RBA)
3)  Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).

## Geographical Regions

Data is broken down into regions by ABS "Statistical Area 4".  This breaks NSW down into regions.  Examples of this are "Mid North Coast" and "Sydney - Inner West". 

## Mortgage Stress Definition

Households where mortgage repayments are greater than 30% of household income.
